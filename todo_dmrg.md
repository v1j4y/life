## Priority 1: ##

1. Verify if correct states are taken while truncating the density matrix.
    + pring the dmat eigenvalues and verify the degeneracy
    + Calculate the S^2 values and compare with the dmat degeneracies.
    + Project out the redundant spin states and verify if we get the same energies.
2. Why does S^2 give the correct values whereas Sz does not !?
3. Are you sure of having the correct S+, S- and Sz operators ?

## Priority 2: ##

1. Check if Mathematica would be able to handle the proper dimensions and other requirements.
2. Project out unnecessary states.
3. Implement the Hubbard matrix.
    a. Implement the Hamiltonian
    b. Implement the Projector for the half filling case
    c. Implement the projection operators which project the hole at given positions
